[Practical Deep Learning using PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKnIA16_Rmvboy8bmDCjwNHgTaYH2puK7)

The playlist covers:-


- Tensors and basic operations
- Building neural networks [ `ANN`, `CNN` ] from scratch
- Using `torch.nn`, `torch.optim`, and `torch.utils.data`
- Image classification
- Model training and evaluation
- Saving and loading models
